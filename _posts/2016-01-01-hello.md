title: hello world
---

hello world to my new personal page. I have an actual blog in Thai
named [tupleblog](http://tupleblog.github.io/) that you can check out.

And I have to mention that I use [Kiko](https://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko), a Jekyll
template, which looks great on my new blog! Thanks **gfjaru** for creating such a
nice, minimalistic theme. Also thanks Github for hosting my personal page. If you
want to host your personal page on Github, follow these [instructions](https://pages.github.com/).

For `favicon`, I created it using [piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/). It's a really
nice web application to create pixel art.
